My Neovim init.vim, which I call my vim_rc as that's the alias I have
set up which takes me right there.

Documentation
=============

Many of the shortcuts in this vim_rc come from plugins, so their
functionality isn't available just by reading this file. Others are
just hard to figure out by reading the vim_rc alone. This documentation
is here to help me remember how to use (some of) my own customizations :P

=== editor shortcuts ===

<leader>c<leader>   - toggle comment of highlighted text
:swp                - strip whitespace
:Tabularize /x      - first highlight some lines, then this aligns
                      the highlighted text based on character x
<leader>a           - go to end of line, 1 space after last character, into mode
<leader>yw          - copy word under cursor without moving it
<leader>yl          - yank line (no newline char at end), without moving
                      the cursor (uses z mark)
<leader>yel         - yank to the End of the Line (no newline char at end),
                      without moving the cursor
<leader>pw          - replace word under cursor with last oving thing (0 register)
>leader>pa          - paste onto the end of the line
<leader>dw          - word under cursor, and the character after it word
>leader>da          - delete every char on line after cursor
<leader>ymn         - yank Elixir module name without moving cursor (uses z mark)
<leader>yq          - yank quoted text (string) beneath cursor
<option/alt>j (k)   - move whole line, or highlighted lines, up (or down)

=== editor navigating ===

<leader>l           - find forwards. Then type letter to jump there
<leader>f           - two letter find, same as normal vim f but 2 letter
'{' and '}'         - skip up/down by paragraph (note: keys are <S-[> and <S-]>)
&                   - GOTO mark command (`), works like address-of in C

=== programming specific ===

<leader>i then <n>  - change fold level (i for indent). n is the level

=== window management & project navigation ===

<backslash>e        - toggle file explorer (side tray, i.e. NERDTree)
<backslash>p        - fuzzy find on git-tracked files
<backslash><S-p>    - fuzzy find on git-tracked files
<backslash>f        - fuzzy find on text in project, only git-tracked files
<backslacs><S-f>    - fuzzy find on all files & folders, no exclusions
<backslacs>4        - open nth tab, example here is 4 but \2 opens 2nd etc.
<leader>jt          - jump to test file, or jump back if test is open (Elixir files only)
<leader>=           - resize all windows to same size
